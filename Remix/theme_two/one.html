	<h1>“Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night”</h1>
	<h2>by Dylan Thomas</h2>

	<p>Do not go <b>addfwyn</b> into that good night,</p>
	<p><b>Henaint</b> should burn and rave at close of day;</p>
	<p>Rage, rage against the dying of the <b>ysgafn</b>.</p>
	<p>Though <b>doethion</b> at their end know dark is right,</p>
	<p>Because their words had forked no <b>mellt</b> they</p>
	<p>Do not go <b>addfwyn</b> into that good night,</p>
	<p><b>Da</b> men, the last wave by, crying how bright</p>
	<p>Their frail deeds might have danced in a <b>gwyrdd</b> bay,</p>
	<p>Rage, rage against the dying of the <b>ysgafn</b>.</p>
	<p><b>Gwyllt</b> men who caught and sang the sun in flight,</p>
	<p>And learn, too late, they <b>alarai</b> it on its way,</p>
	<p>Do not go <b>addfwyn</b> into that good night,</p>
	<p><b>Difrifol</b> men, near death, who see with blinding sight</p>
	<p><b>Dallach</b> eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,</p>
	<p>Rage, rage against the dying of the <b>ysgafn</b>.</p>
	<p>And you, my <b>thad</b>, there on that sad height,</p>
	<p>Curse, bless, me now with your fierce <b>dwfr</b>, I pray.</p>
	<p>Do not go <b>addfwyn</b> into that good night,</p>
	<p>Rage, rage against the dying of the <b>ysgafn</b>.</p>
