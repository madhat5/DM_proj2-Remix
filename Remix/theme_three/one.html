	<h1>“Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night”</h1>
	<h2>by Dylan Thomas</h2>

	<p>Do not go gentle into that good night,</p>
	<p>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;</p>
	<p>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
	<p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,</p>
	<p>Because their words had forked no lightning they</p>
	<p>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
	<p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright</p>
	<p>Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,</p>
	<p>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
	<p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,</p>
	<p>And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,</p>
	<p>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
	<p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight</p>
	<p>Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,</p>
	<p>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
	<p>And you, my father, there on that sad height,</p>
	<p>Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.</p>
	<p>Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
	<p>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
