	<h1>“Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night”</h1>
	<h2>by Dylan Thomas</h2>

	<p style="color: #000000;">Do not go gentle into that good night,</p>
	<p style="color: #000000;">Old age should burn and rave at close of day;</p>
	<p style="color: #121212;">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
	<p style="color: #121212;">Though wise men at their end know dark is right,</p>
	<p style="color: #2e2e2e;">Because their words had forked no lightning they</p>
	<p style="color: #2e2e2e;">Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
	<p style="color: #4b4b4b;">Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright</p>
	<p style="color: #4b4b4b;">Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,</p>
	<p style="color: #656565;">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
	<p style="color: #656565;">Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,</p>
	<p style="color: #7e7e7e;">And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,</p>
	<p style="color: #7e7e7e;">Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
	<p style="color: #989898;">Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight</p>
	<p style="color: #989898;">Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,</p>
	<p style="color: #b2b2b2;">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
	<p style="color: #b2b2b2;">And you, my father, there on that sad height,</p>
	<p style="color: #cdcdcd;">Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.</p>
	<p style="color: #cdcdcd;">Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
	<p style="color: #e4e4e4;">Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
