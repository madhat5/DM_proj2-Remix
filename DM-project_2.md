## Project: Remix

Find an existing poem or piece of text to typeset. The text should already be written by someone else, and should easily fit on one printed page. You will make 15 variations of this text. Each variation will be a separate webpage. For each variation, you will focus on changing the poem's form through shifts in composition, typography, hierarchy, scale, and pacing. Define 5 themes for changes for the poems. For each of the themes come up with 3 variations of rulesets each.


*Deliverables*
- 1st week
    - Pick your poem/text, and your 5 themes.
    - code at least one ruleset for each. (so you should have 5 pages in total for next week.)
- 2nd week
    - remaining

`“Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night”`
by Dylan Thomas

Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
And you, my father, there on that sad height,
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
Do not go gentle into that good night.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
